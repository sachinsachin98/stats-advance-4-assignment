    "T-Test:\n",
    "The t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown, and the sample size is small. It uses the t-distribution to account for the uncertainty introduced by estimating the population standard deviation from the sample. There are different types of t-tests, such as the independent samples t-test for comparing means of two independent groups and the paired samples t-test for comparing means of paired or matched observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Scenario for T-Test:\n",
    "Suppose you want to test whether a new teaching method has a significant effect on student performance. You collect test scores from two groups: one group taught using the new method and another group taught using the traditional method. Since you don't know the population standard deviation of the test scores, and your sample sizes are relatively small, you would use an independent samples t-test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the means of the two groups.\n",

    "Z-Test:\n",
    "The z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known or when the sample size is large (typically n > 30). It assumes that the sample mean follows a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem. Because of the larger sample size assumption, the z-test can be more powerful than the t-test.\n",

    "Example Scenario for Z-Test:\n",

You have a large sample of participants (more than 30) and you know the population standard deviation of weight loss for this program. You want to determine if the average weight loss in your sample is significantly different from a claimed average weight loss of 5 kg. In this case, you could use a z-test to test the hypothesis and make a decision about whether the program's average weight loss is significantly different from the claimed value."

The critical region for the test is located entirely on one side of the distribution, either the left side or the right side, depending on the specific hypothesis being tested.\n",

    "A two-tailed test, also known as a non-directional test, is a type of hypothesis test where the null hypothesis is tested against an alternative hypothesis in both directions. In this case, you are interested in detecting a change or difference in either direction from the hypothesized value. The critical region for the test is divided between the two tails of the distribution.\n",

    "A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain a population parameter, such as a mean or proportion, with a certain level of confidence. It is a way of quantifying the uncertainty of an estimate based on a sample of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence interval is typically expressed as an interval estimate, such as \"95% confidence interval for the mean is between 3.2 and 5.8\". This means that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times, 95% of the time the true population mean would be within this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a confidence interval, we need to know the sample size, the sample mean, and the standard error of the mean (SEM), which is a measure of the variation in the sample means. The confidence interval is based on the standard normal distribution or t-distribution, depending on the sample size and whether the population standard deviation is known.\n",
